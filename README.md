# Inverting-Amplifier-Using-Op-Amp
An inverting amplifier is one of the fundamental op-amp configurations used to amplify a signal while inverting its phase (i.e., a 180° phase shift). It's widely used in analog electronics for signal processing. Let’s break down how to build and understand an inverting amplifier using an operational amplifier (op-amp) like the LM741 or TL081.
